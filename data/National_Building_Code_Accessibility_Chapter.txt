NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA 2016 - ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS (EXCERPTS)SOURCE: National Building Code of India 2016, Part 3: Development Control Rules and General Building Requirements, Annex B: 'ANTHROPOMETRICS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR BARRIER FREE BUILT ENVIRONMENT'.PURPOSE: The present document serves as a delineation of selected excerpts and summaries of pivotal accessibility standards, as they pertain to the design and construction of public retail environments. It is promulgated for the utilization of architects, designers, and project managers for the purpose of ensuring statutory compliance and promoting the principles of universal design. The content herein elaborates upon minimum requirements to furnish a more lucid understanding of the design intent subtending each regulation.SECTION 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES & SCOPE1.1 ScopeThe stipulations promulgated herein are deemed applicable to all buildings and facilities intended for public use. This classification includes, but is not limited to, mercantile buildings—a category that encompasses all retail stores, shops, department stores, and shopping malls—in addition to educational facilities, healthcare establishments, and governmental edifices. The superordinate objective is the assurance that the built environment is designed to be usable to the fullest extent possible by all persons, irrespective of age, physical dimension, ability, or disability. This mandate includes considerations for all patrons, employees, and members of the public who may interact with the constructed space. It is a recognized tenet that a truly accessible environment may enhance the commercial viability and social inclusivity of a development through the expansion of its potential user base, which includes not only persons with permanent disabilities but also the elderly, pregnant women, parents with strollers, and individuals with temporary injuries, and by demonstrating robust corporate social responsibility in alignment with national legislative frameworks such as the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.1.2 Guiding PrinciplesThe foundational tenet upon which the concept of a barrier-free environment is predicated is the enablement of persons with disabilities to ambulate and function with autonomy, safety, and dignity. It is incumbent upon the design process to afford due consideration to individuals manifesting a wide spectrum of disabilities. Such considerations include, inter alia:Non-ambulatory conditions: Necessitating the use of wheelchairs, which in turn require continuous, step-free routes of travel, adequate clear floor space for maneuvering (including 180-degree and 360-degree turns), and reachable controls positioned within established ergonomic ranges for seated individuals.Semi-ambulatory conditions: Where individuals who utilize crutches, canes, or walkers benefit from the provision of supportive handrails along circulation routes, designated areas for rest to mitigate fatigue, and non-slip surfaces to prevent falls.Sight impairments: Where individuals who are blind or have low vision require tactile ground surface indicators (TGSIs) to provide warnings of impending hazards such as stairs or vehicular crossings, high-contrast signage with Braille for identification, and environments devoid of protruding hazards that cannot be detected by a long cane.Hearing impairments: Where individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing require the provision of visual emergency alerts, such as strobe lights, and advantageous sightlines for visual communication.Other impairments: Including those of a cognitive or developmental nature, who benefit from logical, consistent layouts, clear and simple pictographic signage, and predictable environments that reduce confusion and sensory overload.The standards herein delineated constitute minimum requirements; consequently, the adoption of the 'Universal Design' philosophy—the design of products and environments to be usable by all people to the greatest extent possible without necessitating adaptation—is recommended. This proactive approach results in an environment that is not merely compliant, but is inherently more comfortable and convenient for the entirety of the population.SECTION 2: SITE DEVELOPMENT & EXTERNAL CIRCULATION2.1 Parking for Persons with DisabilitiesReservation: In parking facilities accommodating between two and fifty vehicles, a minimum of one parking space shall be reserved and conspicuously marked. In facilities accommodating more than fifty vehicles, one such space shall be reserved for every one hundred spaces, or part thereof.Location: It is a requisite condition that these reserved spaces be situated upon the shortest possible accessible route from the primary building entrance, the distance of which should preferably not exceed 30 meters. The designated route must be entirely devoid of gradational changes such as steps or kerbs.Dimensions: A standard accessible parking bay shall possess a minimum width of 3600 mm. In instances where access by van is anticipated, a bay width of 4800 mm is to be preferred, as this furnishes an adjacent "access aisle" of at least 1500 mm. This aisle constitutes a critical safety zone for the deployment of a wheelchair lift or for the unimpeded transfer of an individual from the vehicle to a wheelchair. Access aisles must be clearly demarcated with hatching and must remain free from all obstructions.Surface: The surface of the parking bay and its associated access aisle is required to be firm, level, with a maximum slope not exceeding 1:50 in any direction for proper drainage without affecting stability, and non-slip.Signage: The parking bay shall be designated with the International Symbol of Accessibility, applied directly to the ground surface. In addition, a vertical sign must be installed at the head of the parking bay, with its lower edge positioned at a height between 1200 mm and 1500 mm to ensure its visibility, even when a larger vehicle is parked in the space.2.2 Walkways, Paths, and PavementsSurface: It is hereby mandated that all walkways possess a continuous, firm, and non-slip surface. The use of loose gravel, sand, or uneven cobblestones is impermissible on an accessible route due to their inherent instability.Gradient: The running gradient of any walkway shall not exceed a ratio of 1 in 20. The cross-slope shall not exceed a ratio of 1 in 50.Width: A minimum continuous clear width of 1800 mm shall be maintained for any walkway or path. In no circumstance shall the clear width be less than 1200 mm.Kerb Ramps: The provision of kerb ramps is required at all pedestrian crossings and intersections. The slope of a kerb ramp shall not be steeper than 1 in 12. It is imperative that the transition from the ramp to both the walkway and the road be perfectly flush and devoid of any level difference, which can act as a significant trip hazard or a complete barrier for small-wheeled mobility devices. Flared sides on kerb ramps, where provided to accommodate pedestrian traffic from the side, should themselves possess a slope not exceeding 1 in 10. A level landing of at least 1200mm in depth should be provided at the top of the kerb ramp.SECTION 3: BUILDING REQUIREMENTS - INTERNAL CIRCULATION3.1 RampsRequirement: The provision of ramps is necessitated wherever a change in level occurs and should be provided as an alternative to, and not in lieu of, stairs. Ramps constitute a primary means of vertical circulation for wheelchair users, individuals utilizing strollers or rolling luggage, and those for whom negotiating stairs is difficult or hazardous.Slope: The maximum running slope of a ramp shall not exceed a ratio of 1 in 12 (8.33 percent). For short distances, defined as a total rise of less than 150mm and a horizontal projection of less than 1500mm, a slope of 1 in 10 may be deemed acceptable. However, a gentler slope, such as 1 in 20 (5 percent), is invariably preferred for its superior ease of use, as it requires substantially less physical exertion to ascend and provides greater control during descent.Clear Width: The minimum clear width of a ramp, measured between the innermost faces of the handrails, shall be 1200 mm. For high-traffic public buildings, a width of 1800mm is recommended to allow for comfortable passing.Landings: Ramps are required to have level landings possessing a minimum length of 1500 mm at both the top and bottom termini. Intermediate level landings, with a minimum length of 1800 mm, shall be provided for every 9000 mm of horizontal ramp run. Such landings are essential not only for negotiating changes in direction but also as designated resting points.
